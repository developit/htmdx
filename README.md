# HTMDX: Lightweight runtime for mdx-like markdown

This library is an attempt to provide a runtime to compile [mdx](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx)-like markdown files (with the goal to support full JSX inside of markdown) using [htm](https://github.com/developit/htm) + [marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) that is much smalled in file-size as opposed to the official runtime (which we are not encouraged to use on actual websites).
